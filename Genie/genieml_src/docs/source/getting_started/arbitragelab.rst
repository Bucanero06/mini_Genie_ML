ArbitrageLab
============

The library is a collection of algorithms from the best academic journals and graduate-level textbooks, which focuses
on the branch of statistical arbitrage known as pairs trading. We have extended the implementations to include the
latest methods that trade a portfolio of n-assets (mean-reverting portfolios).

**ArbitrageLab is built for teams that want to hit the ground running and focus on generating PnL.**

We cover all of the landmark papers as well as the latest techniques, giving you access to the best intellectual
property.

Overview of the Package
#######################

1. **Production-Ready Implementations**

We perform a deep literature review and code up (python) all of the landmark papers and the latest developments in
the field of statistical arbitrage. All of our code is unit tested and well documented. A big advantage is that your
analysts can read and validate all of our code.

2. **Documentation**

Our documentation forms the basis of your onboarding. It guides you through each implementation, starting with the
theory, linking to the original papers, and some light code examples to get you started.

3. **Example Notebooks**

For those that want to do a deep dive, we have built Jupyter Notebooks that explore various techniques more
thoroughly. Try out the implementation with real data and build an intuition as to how you can develop your own
trading strategies.

4. **Auditable and Runs Locally**

A big advantage of our libraries is that they run locally on your machines and the source code is viewable, meaning
that your team can read and validate all of our implementations.

5. **Real-Time Feedback**

We set up a Slack Channel for all users of ArbitrageLab to ask us and the community questions regarding the library
as well as provide feedback that we can add to our next release and build the best library for your use cases.

6. **Maintained Code**

We continue to maintain the code, fix bugs, and add new implementations on a regular basis. We also version all of
our code and maintain a changelog so your company can swap between versions at any time.
