PortfolioLab
============

PortfolioLab is a python library that enables traders who want to take advantage of the latest portfolio optimisation
algorithms used by professionals in the industry.

It included all the functionality previously available in the Portfolio Optimisation and Online Portfolio Selection
Modules of the MlFinLab package. Future versions of the PortfolioLab package will get new tools and updates.

Starting from February 2021 the Portfolio Optimisation and the Online Portfolio Selection Modules of the MlFinLab
package will be deprecated. Please move your implementations to PortfolioLab.

`PortfolioLab package is available here <https://hudson-and-thames-portfoliolab.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/>`_
