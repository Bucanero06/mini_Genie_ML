    "The reason I used bagged decision trees opposed to sklearn's random forest classifier was due to severe overfitting issues I was having with the traditional random forest model. This is very likely a result of observational redundancy in our training set, i.e. many overlapping outcomes. To mitigate the issue of redundancy, Dr. Lopez de Prado recommended using a bagging classifier and setting the max_samples parameter to the average uniqueness of our observations, which helps prevent the creation of many redundant trees. While the bagging classifier supports the max_samples parameter, it is not supported in sklearn's random forest classifier."

As secondary classifiers, however, the bagged SVM and MLP were severely overpredicting the majority class even after adding class weights, upsampling the minority class, and attempting to tune hyperparameters using f1 as the scoring metric. Because of these issues, the bagged decision tree was the only model used as a secondary classifier."

    "The metrics used to evaluate the success and risk of a model were: the Sharpe Ratio, cumulative returns, max drawdown, and percentage normalized profit (PNP). The function I wrote for PNP is inspired by the following paper: Baasheer and Fakhr [2011] [link](http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2011/Penang/ACRE/ACRE-05.pdf), and calculates the percentage of return we achieved out of the total return we could have achieved, had we predicted everything correctly in the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be stated that PNP is not a perfect metric for evaluating our model's profit versus the ideal profit because a bet that didn't reach its return should be classified as a 0, however, let's say that our secondary model misclassifies the bet as a 1 and the actual sign of the return was classified correctly by our primary model. This would present a situation where misclassification gained some profit that the ideal model could not have also gained. Regardless, PNP is still a useful metric in evaluating the profit of the secondary model given the primary model's predictions.\n",
